# Using Stateless
This repository contains an example of using the Stateless library in a C# application to implement a simple state machine.

Overview
Stateless is a lightweight library that provides a simple way to implement state machines in C#. It allows you to define states, triggers, and transitions between states, making it easy to manage the state of an object or system.

In this example, we demonstrate how to use the Stateless library to implement a state machine for a fictional scenario. The state machine transitions between various states based on predefined triggers and conditions.

Features
Lightweight and easy-to-use library for implementing state machines in C#.
Define states, triggers, and transitions using a fluent API.
Support for guards to conditionally allow or deny transitions.
Integration with .NET Core and .NET Framework applications.
Getting Started
To get started with using the example in this repository:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/stevsharp/UsingStateless.git
Open the solution in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code).

Build and run the application to see the state machine in action.

Example Scenario
The example scenario implemented in this repository involves a simple state machine for a traffic light system. The traffic light can be in one of the following states: Green, Yellow, or Red. Transitions between states occur based on predefined triggers such as TimerExpired or ManualOverride.

Usage
To use the state machine in your own projects:

Add the Stateless library to your project using NuGet:

bash
Copy code
dotnet add package Stateless
Define your states, triggers, and transitions using the StateMachine class provided by the Stateless library.

Configure guards and actions for transitions as needed to control the behavior of your state machine.

Use the state machine to manage the state of your objects or systems based on external events and conditions.
